This table is scripted for the common actions that take place during a game of EDH. We have Untap, Draw, Peek/Scry, and Mill/Dredge buttons. As well as scripting shortcuts so you can add hotkeys for them. Lots of dice and counters, but not a lot of the extra stuff that you don't need.

Your deck is registered when you drop it onto the given color's library zone. It can get wonky if you accidentally drag something else through the deck zone. If any of the buttons stop working, drag your deck in and out of the library zone and you should be good to go.
